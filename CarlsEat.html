      <!-- INTRO -->
        <h1>Carls Eat</h1>
        <b>Team Members:</b> <p>Chloe Simanek, Ekow Anderson, Scott Gevurtz, Zubeyda Shute </p>
        <h2>Problem</h2><p>Many Carleton students are unhappy with their dining hall experience, citing issues such as food poisoning, frequently mislabeled dietary information, and the high cost of the meal plan. Our goal is to prototype a platform where students can share and rate meals, suggest dining hall or off-campus meal ideas, and post about food-related deals or events near campus. By using the app, students can plan ahead and improve their overall dining experience.</p>
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>CarlsEat App</p>
        <h3>Low-fidelity Prototype</h3>
        <img src="images/CarlsEat.png" alt="Low-fidelity prototype of the six pages that make up the CarlsEat app. Pages include: home, meal feed, profile, sign-in, post, and deals/events feed" class="prototype" width="1300px">
        <p></p>

        <!-- USER NEEDS -->
        <h2>Adressing User Needs</h2>
        <p></p>
        <b>Posting Options</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Since students have busy schedules, they may not always have time to take a photo of their meal. To address this, the app gives them the option to post images and/or text. 
            The app also allows users to tag their posts with relevant details, such as the dining hall the meal is from or any dietary restrictions it meets, catering to diverse preferences and needs.
            Depending on their experience, users are able to leave a positive or negative review using a five-star rating scale.  
            Finally, users are able to post different types of content (reviews, ideas, or deals/events).</li>
        </ul>
        <b>Use the App Signed-In or Anonymously</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Some interviewees expressed concerns about sharing their identity on the platform. To address this, the prototype allows students to post and view content anonymously if they choose.</li>
        </ul>
        <b>Save Meal Ideas</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Students want an easy way to find and revisit meal ideas. The app includes a feature that lets users save posts, which are then collected in a section accessible on their profile and home page.
            To encourage engagement, popular posts with a high number of saves will be featured in a "Trending" section on the home page.</li>
        </ul>
        <b>Custom Feed</b>
        <ul>
            <li>A collage-style display with filtering options allows users to either browse casually or quickly find the information they need.</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>

                <td>From the home page, users have the option to “Post”. By clicking “Post”, they are taken to a page where they can post a review by following the step-by-step instructions. There are also several other features, such as "Trending" and "Resources", that promote discussion.</td>

              <tr>
                <td>Dietary restriction and preference accommodation</td>
                <td>Users are able to filter and/or tag reviews based on dietary restrictions and preferences (e.g., vegan, gluten-free, high-protein, desserts). Students have a variety of needs, and we want to make it easy for them to find the best meal possible. </td>
                <td>When looking at the feed, users can select a filter at the top of the page. For example, if a student is vegan, they can select the “vegan” tag and only see posts that show vegan-friendly meals. 

                    When posting, users can select tags relevant to their post. They are required to select one of the tags from the first row, while the others are optional.

                <td>Users are able to make reviews in three formats: images, text, and a five-star rating system. People rely on various factors when making meal decisions, so we needed to provide a holistic approach to ratings. For example, some users may quickly want to look at a rating, while others may want a longer description or visual.</td>
                <td>When posting, users are able to upload an image, text, and rate their meal. The only required content is text in order to provide enough context for a post.</td>

          <img src="images/process.png" alt="Steps of the research and analysis process: Step 1 – Interviews, Step 2 – Axial Coding, Step 3 – Affinity Diagram, Step 4 – Axial Coding with Codebook, and Step 5 – Requirements Generation" class="process" width="2000px">
          <h3 color="blue">Research</h3>
          <p>Across our four-person team, we conducted two semi-structured interviews and three focus groups. We started by developing protocols for both a semi-structured interview and a focus group. We tested our protocols through mock interviews and made revisions as needed.</p>

            <p>For the formal interviews, I conducted one of the focus groups. Like the other interviews, my participants were Carleton students. We aimed to include students with diverse meal plans, dietary restrictions, financial aid statuses, and, if possible, those with work-study placements in the dining hall. These interviews gave us insight into students' experiences with Carleton’s dining services, helping us shape our app’s functionality and design.
